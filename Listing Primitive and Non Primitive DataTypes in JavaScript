// There are Total Seven Primitive  && One Non Primitive DataTypes in JS


//Primitive types are:NN(null & number) | SS(String & Symbol) | BB(Boolean & BigInt) | U(Undefined)

let n=null  //the variable n is assigned to NULL or
let num=24    //The num variable is an Integer of Integer type
console.log("This is an Null:",n," This is an Integer:",num)

var str="Hello Prince"
let symbol=Symbol("This is a symbol which will be studied in future")
console.log("This is a String:",str," USe of symbol(Symbol datatype):",symbol)


let flag=true  // here flag varible holds boolean datatype
let big=BigInt("129232123434")   //here big varibles holds large integer using bigInt function
console.log("Boolean Datatype:",flag,"Big Integer Datatype:",big)
console.log(typeof flag)

let nd   //here nd is variable whose value is not defined or is assigned to NULL
console.log("Undefined Varible:",nd)
